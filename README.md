# quotes

###Feature Tasks
Using the Ron Swanson quote api, the app generates a random Ron Swanson quote. If that isn't 
possible, it would use the file allQuotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program 
should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app will choose one quote each time it is ran. Also each Ron Swanson 
quote will be added to the allQuotes.json file.

## Using this app

git clone this repo 
```java
https://github.com/lhchandler4/quotes.git
```
```
cd quotes
```

```
idea .
```

 

###Approach & Efficiency
We used Scanner to read from recentquotes.json file and  Gson to parse file  from Json to Object 

### Testing
